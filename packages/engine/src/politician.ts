/**
 * Politician generation — deterministic NPC office-holders for legislatures.
 *
 * Sources (READ-ONLY mainline at <mainline-checkout>):
 * - Ideology jitter: src/lib/npp/generator.ts `generatePolicyPositions` (lines 419-465).
 *   At quality 0, varianceFactor = Math.max(0.5, 2 - (0+20)/25) = 1.2, and
 *   economic = clamp(base + randomInRange(-varianceFactor, varianceFactor), -5, 5)
 *   social   = clamp(base + randomInRange(-varianceFactor, varianceFactor), -5, 5)
 *   rounded to 1 decimal. We port that at fixed quality 0 for founding seats.
 * - Bounds and clamp: same file `clamp(value, -5, 5)` and `randomInRange(min,max)`.
 * - Age: mainline NPP has no age field (src/lib/db/types/npp.ts, generator.ts —
 *   no age anywhere). We add age locally as uniform int 30..72 via WorldRng.
 * - Names: packages/engine/src/npp/nameGenerator.ts (already ported), via WorldRng.
 *
 * Skipped attributes with no consumer yet (present in mainline NPP but not needed
 * to seat a chamber; listed for later waves): personality (loyalty/ambition/
 * stubbornness), ethnicity + portrait/avatarUrl, favorability, politicalInfluence,
 * funds/currencyBalances/lineOfCredit, archetypeApprovals, influenceState,
 * electionCooldowns, borderKey/tintColor, factionId, isTechnocrat/technocratRole,
 * sequentialId/nextSequentialId bookkeeping, homeState/statePartyOrg quality,
 * domainPositions per legislation type, and campaign/economic defaults.
 *
 * Population scope (this wave): for each playable country, every elected chamber
 * (chamber.elected === true) that has allocated seats (seatsByParty entry >0)
 * gets that many Politicians. Vacancies stay vacant. Appointed chambers
 * (elected === false) and subnational elected chambers (e.g. US stateSenate,
 * UK regionalCouncil, RU republicSupremeSoviet, DD landAssembly) stay empty
 * this wave — the former are not legislatively elected, the latter are province/
 * republic level and will be populated in a later wave. All randomness flows
 * through the world-creation rng passed into `createPoliticiansForWorld`.
