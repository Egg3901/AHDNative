 * Ported from `src/lib/turn/presidentialSuccession.ts`

 *
 * When a country's presidency is vacant and a VP is seated, promote the VP
 * to president and clear the VP seat. Must run AFTER impeachment lifecycle
 * (a same-turn conviction vacancy is filled the same turn, mirroring
 * mainline's phase ordering) and after election resolution (a same-turn
 * presidential-election winner already fills the seat, so there is nothing
 * to succeed into).
 *
 * PORT-STUB: mainline's `hasReachedExecutiveTermLimit` gate (blocks a VP who
 * already served the max consecutive terms from succeeding) has no solo
 * counterpart — AHDClient tracks no per-politician term-served counter yet.
 * Every VP is eligible to succeed.
