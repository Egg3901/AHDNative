/**
 * Cold War bloc alignment — solo substitute for src/lib/world/blocMembership.ts.
 *
 * Mainline derives a country's bloc colour from LIVE organisation-membership
 * rows against the era's alignment channels (`resolveAlignmentEra` +
 * `BLOC_BY_POLE`: WEST/WASHINGTON → west, EAST/MOSCOW → east — the map reads
 * the treaty, not a hardcoded judgment table). AHDClient has no
 * organizationMemberships/alignmentEras/INTERNATIONAL_ORGANIZATIONS system
 * ported, so there is no live NATO/Warsaw-Pact roll to read.
 *
 * What DOES exist is W7's command-economy dial: RU and DD are the two
 * playable countries running the planned-economy machinery in 1953 (Warsaw
 * Pact / Comecon satellites — MARKETIZATION_SCHEDULE), which is the exact
 * real-world fact `blocMembership.ts` would resolve to "east" for a 1953
 * preset via the Warsaw Pact's accession channel. This substitutes that one
 * fact: a planned economy is "east"; every other playable country is "west"
 * (in 1953 that's US/UK — no non-aligned band, matching the era's two-bloc
 * shape). PORT-STUB: does not track NATO accession, non-alignment, or a bloc
 * changing after 1953 (no alliance-accession system to move it).
