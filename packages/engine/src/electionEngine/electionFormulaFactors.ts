 * Personal-stat (politicalInfluence / favorability) tenure fatigue —

 *
 * Root-cause context: politicalInfluence and favorability grow every turn a
 * character/NPP campaigns (Campaign: flat +1%/action; Advertise: +3 base,
 * floored at +1) but only DECAY toward a floor (PI: 0.75% of current per
 * turn) or above a fixed threshold (favorability: only above 60). Neither
 * has the mean-reverting design `electionCandidates.support` already uses
 * (regresses to 50 every active-election turn, cleared on resolution).
 * Net effect: any character who keeps campaigning asymptotically pins near
 * the 100 cap (decay is negligible next to a single action's flat gain, even
 * right at the cap: 0.75 decay vs 1.0 gain), while a non-campaigning rival
 * decays toward the floor — a permanent, non-shrinking separation that
 * re-arms every election because neither stat is per-cycle-reset like
 * Support is. Confirmed on the 654-turn `ahd_sim_grand53fx` world: the
 * recurring president carried a 3.6x politicalInfluence gap (36.1 vs 10) and
 * a +28-point favorability gap over a challenger who never held the office.
 *
 * This channel bypasses the ±10pt `INCUMBENCY_SHIELD_MAX` cap entirely — PI
 * and favorability feed `appealWeight`'s `reach` and `approval` terms
 * directly, with no tenure-awareness of their own. Compressing the terms'
 * CURVES (e.g. giving `approvalScalar` a diminishing-returns shape) was
 * evaluated and rejected: the existing balance tests
 * (`voteDistribution.test.ts` "balance: favorability impacts vote share")
 * deliberately calibrate a large *single-election* favorability or PI gap
 * (60-80 points) to a decisive (~4-9x) advantage, and the real-world gaps
 * measured above (26-28 points) sit BELOW that calibrated range — so any
 * cap loose enough to preserve the calibrated single-election tests is too
 * loose to touch the actual bug, and any cap tight enough to touch the bug
 * breaks the calibrated tests. There is no viable magnitude-based threshold.
 *
 * The actual defect is not "a large gap is unfair" (a genuinely popular
 * first-term candidate SHOULD win decisively) — it's that the SAME party
 * carries the SAME gap into every election for 12 years straight because
 * nothing about the gap is tenure-aware. So — like the economic referendum
 * channel already does on the national-share side — this
 * erodes the tenure-holder's effective PI/favorability by a fixed number of
 * points per consecutive term beyond the first, gated on tenure data that's
 * only present for single-winner races with tracked incumbency (US
 * President via `incumbentConsecutiveTerms`, US Senate via
 * `legislativeIncumbentTenureTerms`). Absent tenure data (first term, open
 * seat, or a race family with no individual-tenure tracking, e.g. US House's
 * multi-seat aggregate) this is a complete no-op — existing single-election

 * through Org's `share^0.2` curve, so a 2.5%-polling party (1951 Liberals) paid
 * a mere ~0.66× penalty vs a ~49% party and landed at ~24% of the vote. This

 * normalization a 2.5% party lands in single digits, not the twenties.
 *
 * Input is `statePartyOrg.registrationShare` (0-100) — a SEED-authored share
 * of the region's partisan electorate, written today only by the UK org
 * calculation path from era polling tables. It is deliberately a separate

 *   untouched.
 *
