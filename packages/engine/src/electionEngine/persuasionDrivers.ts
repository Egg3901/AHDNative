/**
 * `persuasion_drivers(P_j vs P_i)` — captures every cross-party signal
 * that moves voters from P_i toward P_j in a general election.
 *
 * Per §7.3.2 of `docs/design/political-system-reg-support.md`, this
 * returns a signed contribution in `[-1, +1]`:
 *   - positive: P_j is more persuasive to P_i's marginal voters than P_i is to itself
 *   - negative: P_i defends successfully (no swing in this direction)
 *
 * Components contributing (each clamped to a slice of the budget):
 *   - **Candidate Support delta** — how much momentum advantage does
 *     P_j's candidate have over P_i's? (Mood lift on the swing line,
 *     not on the nominal_share line.)
 *   - **Policy distance** — how close is P_j's ideology to the state's
 *     median voter relative to P_i? Centrism proxy on the candidates'
 *     own positions until per-state median-voter data lands.
 *   - **Money / spend** — log-ratio of campaign funds. 10× advantage
 *     saturates the slice (diminishing-returns curve).
 *   - **Incumbency** — for legislatures, a small positive shield scaled by
 *     prior seat-share. For single-winner executive own-races it scales with
 *     the sitting executive's approval: a shield when popular, a drag when
 *     unpopular (see `approvalAdjustedIncumbencyBudget`).
 *
 * The returned value is the sum of components clamped to `[-1, +1]`.

 *   - Money (0.20): diminishing returns; capped per log-ratio shape.
 *   - Incumbency (0.10): smallest; matches research on incumbent edge.
