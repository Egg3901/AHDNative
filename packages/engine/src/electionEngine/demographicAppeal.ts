 *
 * γ=2 was the legacy squared curve. It gave the position term a ~50-110×
 * dynamic range across realistic candidate-group distances, which made every
 * non-ideology lever numerically irrelevant: favorability is at most a ~3×
 * scalar, Org ~2×, and persuasion drivers ~1.4× - all rounding errors next to
 * a 50×+ ideology term. γ<2 compresses that range so campaigning actually
 * moves outcomes.
 *
 * The expression is endpoint-matched: for any γ, positionRaw=0 → 0 and

 * unchanged and MAX_APPEAL-normalized consumers (voteCalculations.ts
 * rawPotential, pollCalculations.ts) are unaffected in scale. Setting this

 * lean direction. Captures the tribal-voter intuition that right-leaning
 * voters prefer a right-leaning candidate over a centrist, even when the
 * centrist is closer in absolute distance.
 *
 * History: originally calibrated to 15 per axis (max +30 when both axes
 * align) via the N2 sim calibration sweep against the legacy γ=2 (squared)
 * position curve - at 15 the centrist-vs-extremist scenario (Scenario 6)
 * landed at +38pt, in the 30-40pt target range; lower values (7.5, 10)
 * didn't bring the blowout down far enough. See
 * `2026-05-22-nominal-share-appeal-tribal-recalibration.md`.
 *
 * Recalibrated 2026-07-09 alongside APPEAL_POSITION_EXPONENT = 1.5
 * ("soften-appeal"): with the position term's dynamic range compressed, the
 * old flat +15/axis bonus came to dominate positioning, and the A/B sweep
 * showed 15/axis erased the competitiveness gain the softer exponent was
 * meant to buy. 5 per axis (bonus scale 0.33) was the only combination in
 * the sweep that moved competitive share (races within 10pt: 40.4% → 46.2%)
 * while keeping winner-match ABOVE baseline (86.5% vs 84.6%; 52-race
 * resolved gov+senate corpus, turn 979). The two constants are a paired
 * calibration: restoring legacy behavior means BOTH γ=2 AND bonus=15.
 *
 * Effect: in a right-leaning group (EP=+1, SP=+1), a right-leaning
 * candidate at (+3, +3) now gets +2×bonus positionScore that a centrist
 * at (0, 0) doesn't, partially offsetting the centrist's squared-distance
 * advantage. The centrist still wins ideologically neutral groups
 * (no directional alignment available there).
 *
 * Edge cases:
 *   - Group at exactly 0 on an axis: no directional preference; no bonus
 *     applies for any candidate on that axis. Reduces to current behavior
 *     in politically neutral groups (correct - they're effectively all
 *     swing voters).
 *   - Candidate at exactly 0 on an axis: pure centrist on that axis;
 *     gets no bonus but also no penalty. Their cross-appeal is intact
 *     via the absolute-distance term.

 * (`voteDistribution.test.ts` "zero favorability candidate gets effectively no

 * the multiplier spread falls from **2.60x to 2.15x**, a ~17% reduction -
 * deliberately marginal. Favorability stays the strongest single lever; it
 * just stops being decisive enough that a coordinated reputation strike
 * substitutes for campaigning. Paired with a raised cost on the ±1 influence
 * actions and a per-turn aggregate backstop, plus strengthened political
 * operations, so the weight lost here moves to levers that cost money and
