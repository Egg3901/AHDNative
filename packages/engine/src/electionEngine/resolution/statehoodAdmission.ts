/**
 * Statehood admission — era-windowed pressure, not a script.
 *
 * Statehood in this codebase is defined by presence in the active apportionment
 * map (see `initializeOfficials`: "the apportionment map is what defines
 * statehood"). That map is a frozen per-preset constant, so a territory absent
 * from it — Alaska and Hawaii under `1953-default` — was seeded but seatless
 * and could never become a state. `runCensus` can reapportion, but it only ever
 * redistributes among states that already hold seats; nothing could ADMIT.
 *
 * This module supplies the missing transition, under the program's design law:
 * **gravity, not rails**. Admission is not scripted to fire in 1959. Each
 * territory carries a window and a cumulative admission curve whose median sits
 * on the historical year, so a world left alone will usually admit Alaska and
 * Hawaii around 1959 — and sometimes in 1956, sometimes in 1963. It is a pull,
 * not a timetable.
 *
 * The curve is expressed as a CDF rather than a per-year hazard, because the
 * property worth guaranteeing is "the median lands on the historical year", and
 * a CDF states that directly instead of leaving it to emerge from tuning. The
 * per-year hazard is derived from it.
