/**
 * Bloc-list seat allocation — the National Front model.
 *
 * In a bloc-list chamber the party split is NOT an outcome of the vote. Each
 * party carries a negotiated quota (see `@/lib/constants/blocList`), and the
 * election only decides how that party's own slate divides its slots. This is
 * the DDR Volkskammer and, structurally, every single-list Eastern-bloc
 * assembly: one list, agreed shares, a vote that ratifies rather than chooses.
 *
 * Two properties the ordinary proportional path cannot give us:
 *
 *  1. The party split is unbreakable by candidate positioning. Under PR plus a
 *     ruling-party vote multiplier, a well-fitted bloc-party candidate out-polls
 *     the ruling party and takes the chamber with it, which is exactly what the
 *     live 1953 world was about to do (LDPD 35.9% against SED 19.1%). Quota
 *     allocation has no such failure mode because the vote never touches the
 *     split.
 *  2. The intra-party contest still decides everything inside a party's block,
 *     which is the contest DDR politics actually had.
 *
 * SEAT REPRESENTATION. Following `allocateSeats`, a candidate holds a BLOCK of
 * seats rather than a single seat: a race with `totalSeats: 90` and four
 * candidates returns four counts summing to 90. Both stages here are therefore
 * largest-remainder splits (quota across parties, then a party's block across
 * its own candidates), and both conserve their total exactly.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic; ties break on the caller's stable ranking.
 */
