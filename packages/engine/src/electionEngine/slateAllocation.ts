/**
 * Slate-level (party-nested) split of a demographic group's vote pool.
 *
 * A straight per-candidate split lets a party fielding two comparable
 * candidates take two shares of every group's pool, so seat count scales with
 * ballot slots rather than support. Split by SLATE instead: a slate's weight
 * is the MEAN of its candidates' appeal weights, then divide the slate's take
 * among its own candidates by within-slate weight share. Slate size cancels;
 * slate quality still matters (a weak co-partisan drags the mean).
 *
 * Independents are never pooled. Each stands as its own slate, mirroring
 * `eligibilityGroupKey` in `turn/election/seatAllocation.ts` so the eligibility
 * gate and the vote split agree on what a "party" is.
 *
 * Byte-identical for one-candidate-per-party races (every FPTP family and
 * every primary). Only multi-candidate-per-party races move.
