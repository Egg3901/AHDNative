// ─── FPTP vote-splitting constants ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// In First Past the Post states, the vote-splitting (spoiler) effect is modelled
// explicitly: a third-party candidate draws votes directly from the ideologically
// nearest major-party candidate, potentially handing the race to the opposite
// major party.  This is Duverger's Law from the major party's perspective —
// they face an existential threat whenever a third party occupies nearby
// ideological space, since that third party can bleed their coalition and flip
// the seat to the opposition.
//
// The spoiled votes are drawn from the nearest major-party candidate (Manhattan
// distance on the economic/social grid) in proportion to the third party's own
// group-level allocation.  Scaling by the third party's own vote count means
// marginal third parties cause marginal spoiling; a large, well-organised third
// party causes significant spoiling.
//
// In RCV states (state.votingSystem === "rcv") this step is skipped entirely,
// since ranked-choice voting lets voters safely express a third-party first
// preference without harming their second choice — eliminating the spoiler dynamic.
