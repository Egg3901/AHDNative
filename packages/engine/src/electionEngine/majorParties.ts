/**
 * Major-party resolution for FPTP spoiler modelling (#811).
 *
 * `getMajorPartiesForRegion` returns seed slugs and abbreviations, but live
 * candidates store `party` as the party's sequentialId string, so for the UK
 * and Japan the slug set matched nothing, `majorParties` came back empty and
 * the whole spoiler pass (and the poll mirror of it) was silently skipped.
 *
 * Resolution order per candidate: `party` in the set, then `partyAbbr` in the
 * set. If that yields fewer than two major parties while the race has three or
 * more parties, the two parties carrying the most weight (nominal votes or
 * poll pool) are treated as major. A two-party race has no third party to
 * spoil, so it returns everything as major and the caller's guard skips.
