/**
 * Fund generation phase.
 * Ports src/lib/turn/fundGeneration.ts processFundGeneration at mainline-neutral
 * scale but adapted to solo's opaque regions and politician-centric income.
 *
 * Each politician generates funds per turn using getTotalFundGenerationForPolitician
 * at a neutral population (5M = medium tier, 10k base) and GDP scalar 1.0.
 * Taxes: stateTaxRate and nationalTaxRate are PORT-STUB at neutral 0 unless
 * parties configure them; solo defaults to 5% national tax if party.treasury
 * exists to keep a party income stream. Real mainline uses party-specific
 * nationalTaxRate/stateTaxRate per StatePartyOrg; solo uses a flat 5% split
 * when treasury income is enabled.
 *
 * Deterministic pure phase.
