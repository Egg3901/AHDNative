/**
 * Central bank types — solo port of src/lib/db/types/centralBank.ts (CentralBank
 * subset actually consumed by the ported cluster: npcBankPolicyTurn's real target
 * — the autonomous chair's Taylor-rule rate setter — plus chair term tracking).
 *
 * W3 scope: one bank per playable country (US/UK/RU/DD). Every bank is bootstrapped
 * directly in the autonomous technocrat mode (chairMode: "npp"): mainline seats a
 * character/player chair via presidential appointment (or Senate-confirmed FOMC
 * nomination for the US Fed), and only falls back to an NPP technocrat when no
 * candidate is available (src/lib/turn/centralBankChairSelection.ts, the
 * `appointNppChair` branch).
 *
 * W24 wires the appointment ATTRIBUTION half of this: `chairAppointedBy`
 * records the sitting president (if any) at each term-expiry rotation
 * (centralBank/phases.ts `centralBankChairChairSelectionPhase`), the same
 * field mainline's `chairAppointedBy` carries. What stays PORT-STUB is the
 * NOMINATION half — mainline's `nominations`/`lobbyingPool` pool of
 * player-characters the president chooses from. AHDClient has no candidate
 * pool separate from the single player + generated NPC roster to draw a
 * "nominee" from, so every bank's chair remains the autonomous NPP
 * technocrat regardless of whether a president is seated; the president's
 * only observable effect this wave is the attribution stamp. A real
 * nomination flow is blocked on a character-chair-candidate pool (and, for
 * the US, an FOMC board) — neither exists yet, and neither is scoped to
 * "presidential executive" specifically anymore now that W24 has landed.
 *
 * Fields mainline carries that solo omits (cited, not silently dropped):
 *  - chairCharacterId/chairCharacterName/chairAppointedAt, nominations,
 *    lobbyingPool, chairSelectionPending, chairControlsLocked: all part of
 *    the player/president NOMINATION apparatus — PORT-STUB, blocked on a
 *    character-chair-candidate pool (see above).
 *  - fomcBoard/activeFomcMeeting/fomcMeetingHistory/rateChangesThisTerm/
 *    fomcTermStartedAtTurn/lastFomcMeetingTurn/lastFomcVacancyNoticeAtTurn: the
 *    FOMC committee (US only) is staffed by presidential nomination + Senate
 *    confirmation and live player ballots — PORT-STUB, same blocker. Every
 *    solo bank (including US) runs the single-chair autonomous fallback path
 *    instead, which is exactly what mainline does whenever a board cannot
 *    carry a motion (src/lib/centralBank/fomc.ts boardCanCarryMotions) or has
 *    no nominee.
 *  - rateHistory (per-change audit log with changedBy/changedByName): needs a
 *    character to attribute the change to. interestRateHistory (turn/rate only)
 *    is kept — it drives the monetary-lag term in macroCountryTurn.
 *  - governmentControlled / bankReserveRequirement / forexRevenue / reserveBalance
 *    / monetaryOperations / treasuryTransferHistory / lobbying / credit-rating
 *    consumers: all belong to unported systems (private banking, forex, LOC,
 *    Treasury reserve transfers). Out of scope for W3.
