/**
 * Shared NPP stance-target model.
 * Port of src/lib/npp/stanceTarget.ts (mainline).
 *
 * The old drift walked every flexible NPP straight to its home state's
 * electorate centre (cachedEconomicLean / cachedSocialLean). That point
 * maximises the dominant term of the vote-appeal kernel, so over a long-running
 * world every non-stubborn NPP of BOTH parties collapsed onto the same state
 * lean: party contrast vanished and a fixed-position human could never
 * out-position them.
 *
 * The target is now anchored on the NPP's PARTY position and pulled only part
 * of the way toward the state lean, plus a stable per-NPP offset so same-party,
 * same-state NPPs still differ. The party anchor (kept because leanPull < 1)
 * and the offset are what stop the mimicry while still letting an NPP tilt
 * toward the state it represents.
 *
 * Both the ongoing drift and the one-off re-scatter heal compute their target
 * through nppStanceTarget, so a healed NPP already sits on its drift target
 * and the next drift cycle leaves it be instead of re-mimicking.
 *
 * Determinism: pure functions, no rng, no IO. FNV-1a hash is deterministic.
