/**
 * Pure seat-math formation decision for one chamber. Ports the threshold
 * logic mainline computes in `checkAppointmentEligibility`
 * (parliamentaryGovernment.ts:1388-1505): majority threshold
 * floor(totalSeats/2)+1 and the minority-bid floor
 * ceil(totalSeats*0.1538) (both in ./constants.ts).
 *
 * Mainline itself never auto-decides WHICH eligible bid wins — a party or
 * coalition chair proposes, the chamber votes, and any eligible bid
 * (including a minority bid while another party holds an outright majority)
 * can in principle be put forward. Solo has no chair-proposal/chamber-vote
 * interaction layer, so this function collapses that process to a
 * deterministic outcome for the common case, in this preference order:
 *
 *  1. A single party at/above the majority threshold governs alone
 *     ("majority") — the equilibrium outcome mainline's own auto-voting NPPs
 *     produce for a party-line vote when a real majority exists.
 *  2. Otherwise, try a coalition: sort parties by seats descending
 *     (tie-break party id), greedily add the largest remaining party until
 *     the combined total clears the majority threshold. This
 *     greedy-largest-first construction is a solo-only stand-in for the
 *     chair-proposal process — PORT-STUB, not a mainline algorithm (no
 *     coalition-partner-selection function exists in mainline to cite; it is
 *     an emergent result of whichever chair's proposal wins the chamber
 *     vote).
 *  3. Otherwise, the largest single party governs as a minority government
 *     if its seats clear the minority floor.
 *  4. Otherwise there is no eligible bid: the chamber stays hung (null).

 * to the vice-chair ("VC-acting-chair" rule — src/lib/db/types/party.ts:29-31,
 * checkAppointmentEligibility). AHDClient's Party type (types.ts) has no
 * chairId/viceChairId field yet — the W20 leadership wave that would add one
 * had not merged as of this wave. PORT-STUB: feature-detect an optional
 * `chairId`/`viceChairId`/`leaderId` string field on the party record (so
 * this starts working for free the moment a later wave adds one) and fall
 * back to the seat-holding politician of that party with the highest
 * accumulated `partyInfluence` (tie-break: lowest politician id) as a
 * deterministic stand-in for "the party's senior figure" — a reasonable
 * proxy since partyInfluence already exists in this repo as the per-politician
 * standing/seniority accumulator (party/partyInfluence.ts).
 *
 * The player is never returned: mainline's PM path runs through an
 * interactive nomination+chamber-vote flow this wave does not port (see
 * government/phases.ts file doc), so per operator instruction this does not
 * invent a player-PM shortcut — PM is always drawn from `world.politicians`.
