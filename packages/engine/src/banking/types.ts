/**
 * Private banking types — W12 port of mainline's chartered-bank subdocument
 * and its satellite collections.
 *
 * Source: <mainline-checkout>/src/lib/db/types/bank.ts (BankCharter,
 * BankLoan, DepositInsuranceFund — fields kept are the subset this wave's
 * scope actually reads/writes; see banking/bankingTurn.ts and
 * banking/bankSolvencyTurn.ts file docs for the full scope-cut rationale).
 *
 * Scope cut (cited, not silently dropped): mainline's BankCharter also
 * carries an investment/universal charter type running a proprietary trading
 * book (propBook, propBookMarkValue), an interbank market (InterbankLoan),
 * a central-bank margin line and B8 discount window (cbMarginDebt/
 * discountWindowDebt + their arrears/idempotency fields), Regulation Q rate
 * corridors, charter-switch cooldowns, a blacklist, opt-in loan approval, and
 * B7 supervisory capital-adequacy stress testing (capitalStanding,
 * appliedStressLossFraction, undercapitalizedSinceTurn). All of that sits
 * behind mainline's SEPARATE `bankPropTradingEnabled` kill switch
 * (src/lib/banking/featureFlag.ts isBankPropTradingEnabled) or is
 * player-console UX with no origination action ported yet in AHDClient (no
 * "request a bank loan" / "open an investment charter" action exists). W12
 * ports the retail/deposit-taking core only: one bank per playable country
 * (see npcBanks.ts), NPC household deposits + interest, the NPC household
 * bulk loan book, deposit insurance, and solvency/failure. Prop trading,
 * interbank, CB margin, discount window, charter switching, Regulation Q,
 * supervision and loan approval are out of scope for this wave — flagged for
 * operator review, not silently ported partial.
