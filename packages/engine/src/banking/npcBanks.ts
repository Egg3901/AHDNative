/**
 * NPC bank charter seeding — W12 port of src/lib/banking/npcBanks.ts
 * seedNpcBanks.
 *
 * Deviation from mainline (cited in constants.ts NPC_BANKS_PER_COUNTRY doc):
 * mainline spawns 2 dedicated NPP corporations per eligible country and
 * charters each with issueCharter (era-anchored capital requirement, a
 * legalCharterTypes eligibility gate, an NPP_CAPITAL_STATES headquarters
 * check). AHDClient's W9 corporation founding already seeds exactly ONE
 * "financial" sector NPC corporation per playable country unconditionally
 * (corporation/founding.ts — every playable country in every shipped era
 * pack has a nonzero financial weight, see sectorSeedWeights1953.ts), so
 * this module charters THAT corp rather than spawning new ones. There is
 * therefore no eligibility gate to port (issueCharter's legalCharterTypes/
 * NPP_CAPITAL_STATES checks — mainline's own reasons for those, era Glass-
 * Steagall separation and having no HQ state configured, do not apply: the
 * corp already exists and is always chartered retail-only).
 *
 * Capital: real cash moves from the corp's own `liquidCapital` into the new
 * `bankCharter.postedCapital`/`cashReserves` (see constants.ts
 * CHARTER_CAPITAL_LIQUID_CAPITAL_FRACTION doc) — conservation-respecting,
 * unlike mainline's FX-anchored fixed requirement which this module cannot
 * reproduce without an FX/anchor system (see constants.ts file doc).
 *
 * `runNpcBankPolicy` (mainline: pushes CEO-set rate offsets back to the
 * Regulation Q corridor midpoint) is NOT ported: solo charters every bank
 * with depositOffset/lendingOffset = 0 and has no rate-console action to
 * move them away from that, so there is nothing for a policy pass to correct
 * — see types.ts BankCharter file doc for the Regulation Q scope cut.
