/**
 * The United States' presidential primary calendar and delegate tables.
 *
 * \u26a0\ufe0f THIS IS DATA ABOUT ONE COUNTRY, AND IT LOOKED LIKE ENGINE CONFIGURATION.
 * `PRIMARY_WAVES` is the 2020 US calendar -- the Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire
 * primary, Super Tuesday. `DEM_2020_DELEGATES`, `GOP_2020_DELEGATES` and
 * `EV_2020_BASELINE` are keyed by state, and `BUILTIN_PARTY_FAMILY` maps DEM and
 * REP. None of it describes a mechanic; all of it describes the United States.
 *
 * The staggered-primary ENGINE stays in `constants/primaryCalendar.ts`:
 * `PrimaryWaveSchedule`, `getPrimaryWaveSchedule`, `getWaveForTurnsRemaining`,
 * `getDelegateMajority` and `resolvePartyFamily` are read by
 * `primaryStaggerPhase` and `conventionResolution`, which default to `"US"` but
 * are not about it. That file re-exports everything below, so no consumer moved.
 *
 * \u26a0\ufe0f THE TYPE IMPORTS POINT BACK AT THE ENGINE AND THAT IS FINE. Type-only
 * imports are erased, so this is not a runtime cycle. A VALUE import back out of
 * `constants/primaryCalendar.ts` would be one, and would fail on module-init
 * order rather than at build time.
