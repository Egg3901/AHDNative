 * OUT OF SCOPE, confirmed present in mainline but not ported into this
 * formula (per the wave brief): bond-linked inputs (issuedBondDebt /
 * bondHoldingsAnchor / bond-reliance penalty. The W13 bond cluster itself
 * is live in bonds/phases.ts, but these share-price formula inputs are not
 * wired), tech-tree
 * asset value (no tech tree ported), index-fund ownership premium (no index
 * funds ported), construction-in-progress / plants capex (no plants tier
 * ported — corp/constants.ts confirms this), stock splits and their
 * cooldown-smoothing blend (no split action ported — every corp's
 * lastShareStructureTurn is implicitly "never"), IMF bailout multiplier (no
 * IMF system ported), insider-concentration discount (only applies to
 * character-CEO public corps; W10 has no player-run corporations, so it
 * would always evaluate to a no-op multiplier of 1 — porting the dead branch
 * added nothing and is skipped, not silently dropped).
 *
 * The order-flow/sentiment multiplier (sharePrice = fundamentalValue ×
 * sentimentMultiplier × orderFlowMultiplier in mainline) is applied by the
 * turn market phase. Native uses saved public-float trade windows and the
 * available country investor-confidence input; wall-clock event pulses remain
 * outside the offline save contract.
