/**
 * Country political overview state — AHDClient-native national-mood model.
 *
 * There is no mainline counterpart: mainline tracks regional support/turnout
 * inputs, per-politician favorability, and crisis "approval" ticks that nudge
 * player favorability as a proxy (see events/crisis.ts `case "approval"`),
 * but no persistent national approval metric, no regime classification field,
 * and no chamber-officer records (committees track chairs; chambers track
 * only composition). This module gives the country overview a serializable
 * home for those values without inventing history: every number derives from
 * live world data (macro economy, budgets, chamber composition, vacancies,
 * active crises/conflicts) through the provisional weights in constants.ts.
