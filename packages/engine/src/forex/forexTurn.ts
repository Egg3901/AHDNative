/**
 * Forex turn phase — W4 port of src/lib/turn/forexTurn.ts processForexTurn.
 *
 * Solo is a pure in-memory phase: no DB, no volumes, no tradeHistory.
 * Reads: centralBanks primeRate, countries economy (inflation/growth), exchangeRates current.
 * Writes: exchangeRates updated rates + history.
 *
 * Era awareness: initial peg from INITIAL_RATES_1953 (preset-keyed), Bretton
 * Woods peg regime for 1953 (managed peg vs float), rate evolution from
 * inflation differentials + central bank policy (the systems that exist).
 * See constants.ts and regime.ts citations.
 *
 * Command-economy currencies (SUR/DDM) are non-convertible pegs held at baseRate
 * regardless of macro (see regime.ts shouldHoldPeg). Admin hardPeg not yet
 * ported (no admin surface); the structure is there for it.
