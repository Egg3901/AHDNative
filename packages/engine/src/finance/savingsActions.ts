/**
 * Player savings actions — W35.
 *
 * Ports the three savings-management endpoints W12 (private banking) shipped
 * state for (player.savings/savingsHolder) but never wired a player-facing
 * action to move: src/app/api/character/savings/deposit/route.ts (+ its
 * withdraw sibling) and src/app/api/character/savings-holder/route.ts
 * moveCharacterSavings. Cited directly in W12's own file doc (types.ts
 * PlayerCharacter.savingsHolder): "No in-game action currently moves this
 * away from centralBank... the mechanism is real and tested even though it
 * is only reachable via a save edit or cheat today." This wave closes that
 * gap with real actions.
 *
 * Solo simplification (cited): mainline's moveCharacterSavings is
 * multi-currency (per-currency savings buckets) and validates a target
 * bank's charter currency match + blacklist. Solo's player.savings is a
 * single-currency pool (see PlayerCharacter.savings file doc — solo has no
 * per-character currency wallets), so the currency-match check is
 * structurally inapplicable; the blacklist is PORT-STUB (banking/types.ts
 * file doc already cuts blacklist entirely — "Prop trading, interbank, CB
 * margin, discount window, charter switching, Regulation Q, supervision and
 * loan approval are out of scope"). What IS ported: target must be
 * "centralBank" or an ACTIVE deposit-taking bank charter, and a move into a
 * private bank is capped by its cached depositCeiling (bankingTurn.ts
 * recomputes this each turn) — moving away from a bank (including to
 * "centralBank") is always allowed, mirroring mainline's own asymmetry.
