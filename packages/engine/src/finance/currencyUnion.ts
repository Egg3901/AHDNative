/**
 * Currency union adoption — port of src/lib/billEnactment.ts
 * applyEuroAdoptionProvision (lines 298-315). Mainline's only currency-
 * adoption bill path is Eurozone accession: each member country votes in
 * (idempotent add), and once every member in EU_EUROZONE_MEMBERS (DE, IE)
 * has joined, gameState.eurozoneEnabled flips true.
 *
 * PORT-STUB: neither Eurozone member (DE, IE) is a AHDClient-playable country
 * in the 1953 pack (US/UK/RU/DD only), so there is no real union to seed —
 * B08. This module ports the MECHANISM generically (a union is a member set
 * + a per-member join vote + an active flag once all members have joined),
 * proven against a synthetic union in tests. A real union definition is a
 * content-authoring task, not an engine one.
