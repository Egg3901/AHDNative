/**
 * Corporation core types — W9.
 *
 * Scope note (see FRAMEWORK.md determinism doctrine + docs/ROADMAP-1.0.md
 * Lane 2): this ports mainline's corporation TURN math (growth, margin,
 * costs, tax, NPC management, insolvency) at "market system off" defaults
 * (mainline's own default — see file docs in constants.ts). W10 adds the
 * offline share-price and stock-exchange subset below; IPO, M&A, subsidiaries,
 * groups, tech tree, bonds, and banking remain separate future waves.
 *
 * Simplification (cited, not invented): mainline's `Corporation` and
 * `CorporateSector` are separate collections (one corp owns many sectors).
 * W9 seeds exactly one single-sector NPC corporation per (playable country,
 * sector type) pair with nonzero 1953 weight, so `Corporation` here collapses
 * the two into one record. This sidesteps mainline's corp-level aggregation
 * machinery (overhead ceilings across sectors, consolidated-loss-offset tax
 * apportionment, sectorCalculations.ts:549-699) which only matters once a
 * corp can own more than one sector — deferred to a future wave alongside
 * multi-sector ownership / player-run corporations.
 *
 * Source: <mainline-checkout>/src/lib/db/types/corporation.ts (Corporation
 * lines 144-589, CorporateSector lines 622-1264) — fields kept are the subset
 * relevant to production/revenue/costs/NPC-management; M&A/subsidiary/tech/
 * governance fields are omitted (see constants.ts file doc for the full cited
 * scope list). The W10 market record also carries the source-backed
 * turn-window multipliers and compact price history used by the offline stock
 * market.
