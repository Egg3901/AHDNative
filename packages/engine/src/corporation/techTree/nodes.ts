/**
 * Sector tech-tree node content (v2 — branching lanes).
 *
 * Each decade tier forks into two lanes:
 *  - **generic** (Corporate): shared across all 17 sectors, authored once below;
 *  - **sector** (Specialist): unique to each sector type.
 *
 * Each lane has 9 unique nodes per decade (slots 1-9), plus v3 slots 10-15. The CEO commits to ONE lane per
 * decade (first unlock commits); switching requires abandoning that decade. Some
 * nodes carry an `unlockStrategy` effect that makes a production method
 * (SECTOR_STRATEGIES entry) available — modern methods stay locked until then.
 *
 * Cost model: rdScore cost on the first six decades is ~1/6 of v1
 * (40/55/70/85/100/120); later decades continue the table. Unlocking also
 * debits cash as a fraction of the corp's daily gross revenue
 * (TECH_NODE_CASH_REVENUE_FRACTION, optionally overridden per node).
 *
 * Tier ART is shared per (lane, sector, decade) — resolved in ./images.ts, not
 * stored on the node.
