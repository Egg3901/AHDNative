/**
 * Contract settlement turn phase.
 *
 * Ports src/lib/turn/extraction/contractSettlement.ts settleExtractionContracts.
 * Lifecycle: offered→expired (past offer window), active→expired (past term),
 * royalty settlement per turn (rate × share × capacity × price) with
 * insufficient-funds tracking and default at CONTRACT_DEFAULT_MISSED_PAYMENTS.
 *
 * PORT-STUB counterparties: corporations not yet ported (W9 landed after this
 * module — see corporationId doc on ExtractionContract), so corporationId is
 * null for stubbed contracts. Stubbed counterparties always "pay" — we compute
 * the royalty anchor, advance idempotency, and count settled/paid, but skip
 * treasury movement. Insufficient-funds path is exercised only when a
 * contract is marked with a real corporationId that maps to a missing
 * treasury (still stubbed to missed-payment increment for testability).
 *
 * Price source: world.commodityPrices[resource].globalPrice (this turn's
 * market, since we run AFTER commodityPrices).
 * Capacity source: W11 wires world.stateResourceCapacities (real per-region
 * ceilings, depletion-adjusted via extraction/constants.ts
 * depletedCapacityPerTurn) when the caller passes it; falls back to
 * NOTIONAL_STATE_CAPACITY_UNITS below when a contract's region has no
 * capacity doc (e.g. the W1-era test fixtures in commodity.test.ts, which
 * construct ExtractionContract literals directly against a fresh world with
 * no capacities argument — same royalty math as before this wave for those).
 * Missing inputs use mainline-neutral values: 0 capacity or price → 0 due,
 * no charge.
 *
 * Depletion (P3b): each settled turn also draws down the region's
 * extractedUnits[resource] by the SAME units the royalty basis just used
 * (share × capped capacity) — the exact volume mainline's own file doc
 * (stateResourceCapacity.ts) cites as "the same basis as sector.revenue",
 * not an invented utilization constant. A contract with no real capacity doc
 * (fallback path) draws down nothing (there is nothing to deplete).
