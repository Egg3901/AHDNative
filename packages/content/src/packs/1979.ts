/**
 * Ported from mainline AHDGame ("1979-default" preset) — real authored
 * 1979 data, no interpolation, no invented numbers.
 *
 * Source files:
 *  - src/lib/seeds/reference/budgets.ts NATIONAL_BUDGET_SEED_CONFIGS_1979
 *    (population, gdp, currencyCode, economicFactors.gdpGrowth/inflationRate)
 *  - src/lib/constants/currencies.ts INITIAL_RATES_1979 (FX, local per USD)
 *  - src/lib/world/worldEntityManifest.ts COLD_WAR_PLAYER (US/UK/RU/DD
 *    playable — same roster as 1953-default; no 1991-style contraction yet)
 *  - src/lib/constants/countries.ts COUNTRY_CONFIGS (base legislature
 *    seat counts — mainline's ERA_COUNTRY_CONFIG_OVERRIDES has ZERO entries
 *    for "1979-default": every institutional number below is the
 *    era-neutral base config, not a period override, because mainline
 *    itself has none)
 *  - src/lib/constants/historicalSeats.ts SU_SUPREME_SOVIET_1979,
 *    DD_VOLKSKAMMER_1979 (seated one-party compositions)
 *  - src/lib/seeds/uk/ukParties.ts, ru/ruParties.ts, dd/ddParties.ts,
 *    reference/politicalParties.ts (validForPresets filtered to
 *    "1979-default")
 *
 * Conversions (same method as 1953.ts):
 *  - countries[].economy.gdp: budget gdp (local currency, absolute) divided
 *    by INITIAL_RATES_1979[country] (local per USD), then by 1e6 for
 *    millions USD. US is already USD (rate 1.0).
 *  - growthRate/inflationRate: mainline's economicFactors are percent
 *    (e.g. 11.3 = 11.3%); divided by 100 to the fraction EconomySeed expects.
 *
 * Country roster: NATIONAL_BUDGET_SEED_CONFIGS_1979 authors budgets for 19
 * countries; this pack ships 18 of them. HU is EXCLUDED — mainline's
 * INITIAL_RATES_1979 has no Hungary entry (Eastern-bloc satellites besides
 * DD are not forex-active in 1979-default), so there is no non-invented way
 * to convert HU's authored Ft-denominated GDP to USD millions. Rather than
 * pick an FX rate mainline doesn't authorize, HU is omitted from this pack.
 * GENUINE GAP, documented, not fabricated.
 *
 * The 9 countries mainline's COLD_WAR_HIDDEN_1979 list keeps hidden in its
 * UI (PL, RO, YU, HU, CS, BG, UKR, BLR, BAL) are not included here at all —
 * 1953.ts carries some of them because 1953-default has no hidden list, but
 * for 1979 only the budget-authored, non-hidden set is ported.
 *
 * Unemployment: mainline's budgets.ts does not carry an unemploymentRate
 * field (only gdpGrowth/wageGrowth/inflationRate/tradeGrowth). Two figures
 * below are mainline-cited directly from era-flavor comments in
 * src/lib/seeds/{uk,de}/{uk,de}MetricPresets1979.ts (UK "high and rising
 * unemployment", DE "unemployment low (3.4%)"); DD/RU reuse the 1953 pack's
 * own planned-economy proxy (0.5%, full-employment convention, same
 * provenance as pack1953). Every other country's unemploymentRate below is
 * an EXTERNAL historical reference (standard published national annual
 * averages for 1979), NOT a mainline-authored figure — mainline has no
 * per-country 1979 unemploymentRate table for these. Documented gap.
 *
 * No states/regions/demographics table is shipped for this era: mainline's
 * states1979.ts / ukRegions1979.ts / registrationLanes1979.ts are real and
 * citable (see docs/briefs for a future wave) but porting them is deferred;
 * the engine's existing pre-W38/W39 opaque-3-region fallback seeds
 * support/electorate state for this pack instead (same fallback path
 * 1953 used before those waves landed).
